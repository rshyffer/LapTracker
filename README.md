LapTracker
==========

An application to track student's running progress with bar code readers.  The app works with Motorola CS3000 barcode readers which are used to scan student's cards as they complete laps.  The software will collect all the scans and compile a list of laps for each child.  Views will allow the user to see the progress made by each child either by week, month, or total.

The app is written in C# and uses a SQLite database to store records.
